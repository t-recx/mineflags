MineFlags is a two player (hotseat or against the cpu) minesweeper game, similar to one that was very popular on the MSN Messenger app a few years ago.

It was made with Allegro 4.0, but you'll probably be able to compile with newer 4.x versions albeit with warnings.

The agup distribution may not refer to the original one, please check the agup's docs in the agup-0.11 directory.
